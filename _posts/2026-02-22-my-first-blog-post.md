Hello everyone! 👋

Welcome to my very first Jekyll blog post.

Today I learned how Jekyll uses special file names and front matter to create blog posts automatically. It’s interesting how just adding the correct date and title format makes everything work perfectly.

I’m excited to continue building and customizing my blog. Stay tuned for more updates!
